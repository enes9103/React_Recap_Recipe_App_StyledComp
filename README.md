DEMO: 

<!-- DESCRİPTİON -->
## Description
- The application is prepared using the Next.JS Framework.
- React library and React Hooks structures are used in the application.
- All features of the project are in working condition.
- The project looks responsive on all screens.
- https://rickandmortyapi.com/ Api is used for application data.
- Bootstrap is used as UI library.
- The application consists of "HOME", "EPISODES", "EBOUT", "DETAIL" and "PAGENOTFOUND" pages.
- 20 characters are listed on the main page using the relevant API.
- Back and forth options are used as the pagination structure at the bottom of the main page. In each forward or backward state, the next/previous 20 characters are listed according to the id number.
- When a character card component is clicked on the main page, the Detail page of the character can be accessed and the data of the character details are listed.
- The <title> information is given as the character title on the detail page.
- After 20 characters on the login page, other characters can be accessed from the pagination structure. Since the pagination structure is used, the desired virtual scroll is not used in the case.
- The detail page has been prepared with Server Side Rendering and is in dynamic working condition.
- Application dependencies are managed with npm package manager.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
